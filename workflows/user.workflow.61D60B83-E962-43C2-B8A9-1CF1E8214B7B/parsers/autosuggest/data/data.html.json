Support Gecko Presto WebKit Trident   Not implemented Not implemented Not implemented IE4, IE5, IE6, IE7 (Removed in IE8)   Normative document Microsoft's Data Binding: dataSrc Property (MSDN)         href This is the single required attribute for anchors defining a hypertext source link. It indicates the link target, either a URL or a URL fragment, that is a name preceded by a hash mark (#), which specifies an internal target location (an ID) within the current document. URLs are not restricted to Web (HTTP)-based documents. URLs might use any protocol supported by the browser. For example, file, ftp, and mailto work in most user agents.  Note: You can use the special fragment \"top\" to create a link back to the top of the page; for example <a href=\"#top\">Return to top<\/a>. This behavior is specified by HTML5.       hreflang This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory Allowed values are determined by BCP47 for HTML5 and by RFC1766 for HTML4. Use this attribute only if the   href  attribute is present.   media  HTML5 This attribute specifies the media which the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media query. This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets by allowing the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on.  Usage note:  In HTML 4, only simple white-space-separated list of media description literals, i.e. media types and groups, where defined and allowed as values for this attribute, like print, screen, aural, braille, ... HTML 5 extended this to any kind of media queries, which are a superset of the allowed values of HTML 4. Browsers not supporting the CSS3 Media Queries won't necessary recognized the adequate link; do not forget to set fallback links, the restricted set of media queries defined in HTML 4.        methods Non-standard       Unimplemented  The value of this attribute provides information about the functions that might be performed on an object. The values generally are given by the HTTP protocol when it is used, but it might (for similar reasons as for the title attribute) be useful to include advisory information in advance in the link. For example, the browser might choose a different rendering of a link as a function of the methods specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon, or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the current site. This attribute is not well understood nor supported, even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer 4. Methods Property (MSDN)   name  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute is required in an anchor defining a target location within a page. A value for name is similar to a value for the id core attribute and should be an alphanumeric identifier unique to the document. Under the HTML 4.01 specification, id and name both can be used with the <a> element as long as they have identical values.  Usage note:\u00a0 This attribute is obsolete in HTML5, use global attribute id instead.       ping  HTML5  New in Firefox 3    bug 415168  The support for \"ping\" was disabled starting with Firefox 3 beta 3.     rel For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values. The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.     rev  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute specifies a reverse link, the inverse relationship of the rel attribute. It is useful for indicating where an object came from, such as the author of a document.  Note: It is advisable to use the usemap attribute for the <img>  element and the associated <map>  element to define hotspots instead of the shape attribute.    shape  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute is used to define a selectable region for hypertext source links associated with a figure to create an image map. The values for the attribute are circle, default, polygon, and rect. The format of the coords attribute depends on the value of shape. For circle, the value is x,y,r where x and y are the pixel coordinates for the center of the circle and r is the radius value in pixels. For rect, the coords attribute should be x,y,w,h. The x,y values define the upper-left-hand corner of the rectangle, while w and h define the width and height respectively. A value of polygon for shape requires x1,y1,x2,y2,... values for coords. Each of the x,y pairs defines a point in the polygon, with successive points being joined by straight lines and the last point joined to the first. The value default for shape requires that the entire enclosed area, typically an image, be used.     target This attribute specifies where to display the linked resource. In HTML4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:\u00a0Load the response into the same HTML4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML4 window or HTML5 browsing context. _parent:\u00a0Load the response into the HTML4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: In HTML4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames. In HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.  Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.     type This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target. Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small speaker icon when type is set to audio\/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types, see http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.     urnNon-standard       Unimplemented  This supposedly Microsoft-supported attribute relates a uniform resource name (URN) with the link. While it is based on standards work years back, the meaning of URNs is still not well defined, so this attribute is meaningless. urn Property (MSDN)  DOM\u00a0Interface This element implements the HTMLAnchorElement interface.

Furthermore, target is not allowed under strict variants of XHTML but is limited to frameset or transitional forms. JavaScript recommendations It is often the case that an anchor tag is used with the onclick event. In order to prevent the page from refreshing, href is often set to either \"#\" or \"javascript:void(0)\". Both of these values can lead to some unexpected errors when copying links and opening links in a new tab and\/or window.

Default styling The purpose of this element is purely for the convenience of the author and all browsers display it inline (display: inline) by default, though its default styling varies from one browser to another:  Some browsers, like IE, do not style it differently than a <span>  element. Opera, Firefox, and some others add a dotted underline to the content of the element. A few browsers not only add a dotted underline, but also put it in small caps;\u00a0 to avoid this styling, adding something like font-variant: none in the CSS takes care of this case.  It is therefore strongly recommended that web authors not rely on the default styling. Note that this element is not supported by IE prior to IE7.

Example  The <acronym title=\"World Wide Web\">WWW<\/acronym> is only one component of the Internet.  Default styling Though the purpose of this tag is purely for the convenience of the author, its default styling varies from one browser to another:  Some browsers, like IE, do not style it differently than a <span>  element. Opera, Firefox, and some others add a dotted underline to the content of the element. A few browsers not only add a dotted underline, but also put it in small caps; to avoid this styling, adding something like font-variant: none in the CSS take cares of this case.  It is therefore strongly recommended that web authors do not rely on the default styling.

It can be used together with, or in place of, the data attribute.   codebase  HTML 4 only;   Obsolete in  HTML5 The base path used to resolve relative URIs specified by classid, data, or archive. If not specified, the default is the base URI of the current document.   codetype  HTML 4 only;   Obsolete in  HTML5 The content type of the data specified by classid.   data The address of the resource as a valid URL. At least one of data and type must be defined.   declare  HTML 4 only;   Obsolete in  HTML5 The presence of this Boolean attribute makes this element a declaration only. The object must be instantiated by a subsequent <object> element. In HTML5, repeat the <object> element completely each that that the resource is reused.   form  HTML5 The form element, if any, that the object element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an ID of a <form>  element in the same document.   height The height of the displayed resource, in CSS\u00a0pixels.   name The name of valid browsing context (HTML5), or the name of the control (HTML 4).   standby  HTML 4 only;   Obsolete in  HTML5 A message that the browser can show while loading the object's implementation and data.   tabindex  HTML 4 only;   Obsolete in  HTML5 The position of the element in the tabbing navigation order for the current document.   type The MIME\u00a0type of the resource specified by data.

This element is used only within a <map>  element. Usage context    Permitted content Empty; this is a void element.   Tag omission Must have a start tag and must not have an end tag.   Permitted parent elements Any element that accepts phrasing content. The <area> element must have an ancestor <map> , but it need not be a direct parent.   Normative documents HTML 5, section 4.8.13; HTML 4.01, section 13.6.1    Attributes Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.    accesskey  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 Specifies a keyboard navigation accelerator for the element. Pressing ALT or a similar key in association with the specified character selects the form control correlated with that key sequence. Page designers are forewarned to avoid key sequences already bound to browsers. This attribute is global since HTML5.     alt A text string alternative to display on browsers that do not display images. The text should be phrased so that it presents the user with the same kind of choice as the image would offer when displayed without the alternative text. In HTML4, this attribute is required, but may be the empty string (\"\"). In HTML5, this attribute is required only if the href attribute is used.     coords A set of values specifying the coordinates of the hot-spot region. The number and meaning of the values depend upon the value specified for the shape attribute. For a rect or rectangle shape, the coords value is two x,y pairs: left, top, right, and bottom. For a circle shape, the value is x,y,r where x,y is a pair specifying the center of the circle and r is a value for the radius. For a poly or polygon< shape, the value is a set of x,y pairs for each point in the polygon: x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3, and so on. In HTML4, the values are numbers of pixels or percentages, if a percent sign (%) is appended; in HTML5, the values are numbers of CSS\u00a0pixels.     href The hyperlink target for the area. Its value is a valid URL. In HTML4, either this attribute or the nohref attribute must be present in the element. In HTML5, this attribute may be omitted; if so, the area element does not represent a hyperlink.     hreflang  HTML5 Indicates the language of the linked resource. Allowed values are determined by BCP47. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.     name  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 Define a names for the clickable area so that it can be scripted by older browsers.     media  HTML5 A hint of the media for which the linked resource was designed, for example print and screen. If omitted, it defaults to all. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.     nohref  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 Indicates that no hyperlink exists for the associated area. Either this attribute or the href attribute must be present in the element.  Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5, instead omitting the href attribute is sufficient.       rel  HTML5 For anchors containing the href attribute, this attribute specifies the relationship of the target object to the link object. The value is a comma-separated list of relationship values. The values and their semantics will be registered by some authority that might have meaning to the document author. The default relationship, if no other is given, is void. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.   shape The shape of the associated hot spot. The specifications for HTML 5 and HTML 4 define the values rect, which defines a rectangular region; circle, which defines a circular region; poly, which defines a polygon; and default, which indicates the entire region beyond any defined shapes. Many browsers, notably Internet Explorer 4 and higher, support circ, polygon, and rectangle as valid values for shape; these values are Non-standard     .     tabindex  HTML 4 only,   Obsolete in  HTML5 A numeric value specifying the position of the defined area in the browser tabbing order. This attribute is global in HTML5.     target This attribute specifies where to display the linked resource. In HTML4, this is the name of, or a keyword for, a frame. In HTML5, it is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:\u00a0Load the response into the same HTML4 frame (or HTML5 browsing context) as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed HTML4 window or HTML5 browsing context. _parent:\u00a0Load the response into the HMTL4 frameset parent of the current frame or HTML5 parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: In HTML4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames. In HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.  Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.\u00a0   type This attribute specifies the media type in the form of a MIME type for the link target. Generally, this is provided strictly as advisory information; however, in the future a browser might add a small icon for multimedia types. For example, a browser might add a small speaker icon when type is set to audio\/wav. For a complete list of recognized MIME types, see http:\/\/www.w3.org\/TR\/html4\/references.html#ref-MIMETYPES. Use this attribute only if the href attribute is present.  Example \r           <map name=\"primary\">   <area shape=\"circle\" coords=\"200,250,25\" href=\"another.htm\" \/>    <area shape=\"default\" nohref \/> <\/map>\r          DOM\u00a0Interface This element implements the HTMLAreaElement interface. Notes Under the HTML 3.2, 4.0, and 5 specifications, the closing tag <\/area> is forbidden. The XHTML 1.0 specification requires a trailing slash: <area \/>. The id, class, and style attributes have the same meaning as the core attributes defined in the HTML 4 specification, but only Netscape and Microsoft define them. Netscape 1\u2013level browsers do not understand the target attribute as it relates to frames. HTML 3.2 defines only alt, coords, href, nohref, and shape.

This continues until the media cache is full, or the entire audio file has been downloaded, whichever comes first. This should only be used when it is expected that the user will choose to play the audio; for example, if the user has navigated to a page using a \"Play this audio\" link. This attribute was removed in Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1)  in favor of the preload attribute.   buffered An attribute you can read to determine which time ranges of the media have been buffered. This attribute contains a TimeRanges  object.   controls If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause\/resume playback.   loop A Boolean attribute; if specified, we will, upon reaching the end of the audio, automatically seek back to the start.   mozCurrentSampleOffset  Requires Gecko 2.0  Non-standard      The offset, specified as the number of samples since the beginning of the audio stream, at which the audio is currently playing.   preload This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:  none: hints that either the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video or that the server wants to minimize its traffic; in others terms this hint indicates that the video should not be cached; metadata: hints that though the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video, fetching the metadata (e.g. length) is reasonable; auto: hints that the user needs have priority; in others terms this hint indicated that, if needed, the whole video could be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it; the empty string: which is a synonym of the auto value.  If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser can choose its own default value), though the spec advises it to be set to metadata. Usage notes:  The autoplay attribute has precedence over this one as if one wants to automatically play a video, the browser will obviously need to download it. Setting both the autoplay and the preload attributes is allowed by the specification. The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.      src The URL of the audio to embed. This is subject to HTTP access controls. This is optional; you may instead use the source element within the audio block to specify the audio to embed.  Time offsets are specified as float values indicating the number of seconds to offset. Note: The time offset value definition has not yet been completed in the HTML5 specification and is subject to change.

It is typically used for keywords in a summary, product names in a review, or other spans of text whose typical presentation would be boldfaced. Another example of its use is to mark the lead sentence of each paragraph of an article.  Usage notes:   Do not confuse the <b> element with the <strong> , <em> , or <mark>  elements. The <strong>  element represents text of certain importance, <em>  puts some emphasis on the text and the <mark>  element represents text of certain relevance. The <b> element doen't convey such special semantic information; use it only when no others fit. Similarly, do not mark titles and headings using the <b> element. For this purpose, use the <h1>  to <h6>  tags. Further, stylesheets can change the default style of these elements, with the result that they are not necessarily\u00a0displayed in bold. It is a good practice to use the class attribute on the <b> in order to convey additional semantic information (for example <b class=\"lede\"> for the first sentence in a paragraph). This eases the development of several stylings of a web document, without the need to change its HTML\u00a0code. Historically, the <b> element was meant to make text boldface.

Font size then can be varied relative to the base font size using the <font>  element.  Usage note:\u00a0 Do not use this element! Though once (imprecisely) normalized in HTML 3.2, it wasn't supported in all major browsers. Further, browsers, and even successive versions of browsers, never implemented it in the same way: practically, using it has always brought indeterminate results. The <basefont> element was deprecated in the standard at the same time as all elements related to styling only. Starting with HTML 4, HTML does not convey styling information anymore (outside the <style>  element or the style attribute of each element). In HTML 5, this element has been removed completely. For any new web development, styling should be written using CSS only. The former behavior of the <font>  element can be achieved, and even better controlled using the  font , font-family , font-size , font-size-adjust , font-stretch , font-style , font-variant , font-weight , @font-face   properties.  Attributes  Like all other HTML\u00a0elements, this element supports the global attributes.   color This attribute sets the text color using either a named color or a color specified in the hexadecimal #RRGGBB format.     face This attribute contains a list of one or more font names. The document text in the default style is rendered in the first font face that the client's browser supports. If no font listed is installed on the local system, the browser typically defaults to the proportional or fixed-width font for that system.     size This attribute specifies the font size as either a numeric or relative value. Numeric values range from 1 to 7 with 1 being the smallest and 3 the default.  DOM interface This element implements the HTMLBaseFontElement interface.

This attribute enables you to place <button> elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their <form>  elements.   formaction HTML5 The URI\u00a0of a program that processes the information submitted by the button. If specified, it overrides the   action  attribute of the button's form owner.   formenctype HTML5 If the button is a submit button, this attribute specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the server.

Possible values are:  post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server. get: The data from the form are appended to the form attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII\u00a0characters.  If specified, this attribute overrides the   method  attribute of the button's form owner.    formnovalidate HTML5 If the button is a submit button, this Boolean attribute specifies that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the   novalidate  attribute of the button's form owner.   formtarget HTML5 If the button is a submit button, this attribute is a name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the   target  attribute of the button's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:\u00a0Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context. _parent:\u00a0Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one.

If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.     name The name of the button, which submitted with the form data.   type The type of the button. Possible values are:  submit:\u00a0The button submits the form data to the server. This is the default if the attribute is not specified, or if the attribute is dynamically changed to an empty or invalid value. reset:\u00a0The button resets all the controls to their initial values. button: The button has no default behavior.

Normative document HTML5, section 4.9.3 (HTML4.01, section 11.2.4)    Attributes Like all other HTML\u00a0elements, this element supports the global attributes.    align   Deprecated   in  HTML 4.01,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This enumerated attribute specifies how horizontal alignment of each column cell content will be handled. Possible values are:  left, aligning the content to the left of the cell center, centering the content in the cell right, aligning the content to the right of the cell justify, inserting spaces into the textual content so that the content is justified in the cell char, aligning the textual content on a special character with a minimal offset, defined by the   char  and   charoff  attributes  Unimplemented (see  bug 2212 ) .  If this attribute is not set, the left value is assumed. The descendant <col>  elements may override this value using their own   align  attribute. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (not supported) in the latest standard.  To achieve the same effect as the left, center, right or justify values:  Do not try to set the text-align  property on a selector giving a <colgroup>  element. Because <td>  elements are not descendant of the <colgroup>  element, they won't inherit it. If the table doesn't use a   colspan  attribute, use one tr:nth-child(n) CSS selector per column of the colgroup,where n is the ordinal position of this column in the table. Only after this selector the vertical-align  property can be used. If the table does use a   colspan  attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.   To achieve the same effect as the char value, in CSS3, you can use the value of the   char  as the value of the text-align  property  Unimplemented .        bgcolor Non-standard      This attribute defines the background color of each cell of the columns member of the column group.. It is one of the 6-digit hexadecimal code as defined in sRGB, prefixed by a '#'. One of the sixteen predefined color strings may be used:    \u00a0 black = \"#000000\" \u00a0 green = \"#008000\"   \u00a0 silver = \"#C0C0C0\" \u00a0 lime = \"#00FF00\"   \u00a0 gray = \"#808080\" \u00a0 olive = \"#808000\"   \u00a0 white = \"#FFFFFF\" \u00a0 yellow = \"#FFFF00\"   \u00a0 maroon = \"#800000\" \u00a0 navy = \"#000080\"   \u00a0 red = \"#FF0000\" \u00a0 blue = \"#0000FF\"   \u00a0 purple = \"#800080\" \u00a0 teal = \"#008080\"   \u00a0 fuchsia = \"#FF00FF\" \u00a0 aqua = \"#00FFFF\"    Usage note:\u00a0Do not use this attribute, as it is non-standard and only implemented some versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer: the <colgroup>  elements should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect to the bgcolor attribute, use the CSS property background-color  on the relevant <td>  elements.      char   Deprecated   in  HTML 4.01,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute is used to set the character to align the cells in a column on. Typical values for this include a period (.) when attempting to align numbers or monetary values. If   align  is not set to char, this attribute is ignored, though it will still be used as the default value for the   align  of the <col>  which are members of this column group. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard. To achieve the same effect as the   char , in CSS3, you can use the character set using the   char  attribute as the value of the text-align  property  Unimplemented .      charoff   Deprecated   in  HTML 4.01,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute is used to indicate the number of characters to offset the column data from the alignment characters specified by the char attribute. Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard.      span This attribute contains a positive integer indicating the number of additional consecutive columns to apply the attributes of the <column> element. If not present, its default value is 0. Note: This attribute apply on the attributes of the column grup, it has no effect on the CSS styling rules associated to it or, even more, to the cells of the columns members of the group.      valign   Deprecated   in  HTML 4.01,   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute specifies the vertical alignment of the text within each cell of the column. Possible values for this attribute are:  baseline, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible, but align it on the baseline of the characters instead of the bottom of them. If characters are all of the size, this has the same effect as bottom. bottom, which will put the text as close to the bottom of the cell as it is possible; middle, which will center the text in the cell; and top, which will put the text as close to the top of the cell as it is possible.  Note: Do not use this attribute as it is obsolete (and not supported) in the latest standard:  Do not try to set the vertical-align  property on a selector giving a <colgroup>  element. Because <td>  elements are not descendant of the <colgroup>  element, they won't inherit it. If the table doesn't use a   colspan  attribute, use the tr:nth-child(n) CSS selector where n is the ordinal position of the column in the table.

If the table does use a   colspan  attribute, the effect can be achieved by combining adequate CSS attribute selectors like [colspan=n], though this is not trivial.        width   Obsolete in  HTML5 This attribute specifies a default width for each column in the current column group. In addition to the standard pixel and percentage values, this attribute might take the special form 0*, which means that the width of each column in the group should be the minimum width necessary to hold the column's contents. Relative widths such as 0.5* also can be used.  DOM interface This element implements the HTMLTableColElement interface. Examples Please see the <table>  page for examples on <colgroup>.

However, it should not be used simply to apply italic styling; use the <i>  element, or CSS styling for that purpose.

Result In HTML 5, what was previously called block-level content is now called flow content. Italics vs. emphasis It is often confusing to new developers why there are so many ways to express the same thing on a rendered website. Italics and emphasis are perhaps one of the most common. Why use <em><\/em> vs <i><\/i>? They produce exactly the same result right? Not exactly: emphasis is a logical state, and italics is a physical state. Logical states separate presentation from the content, and by doing so allows for it to be expressed in many different ways, perhaps instead of rendering some text as italics you want to render it red, or a different size, or underlined, or even bold. It makes more sense to change the presentational properties for <em> than it does for italics. This is because italics is a physical state; there is no separation of presentation and content, making italics do anything other than italicize text would be confusing and illogical.

If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: HTML 4: Load the response into the full, original window, canceling all other frames.\u00a0 HTML5: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent).

From the DOM iframe element, scripts can get access to the window object of the included HTML page via the contentWindow property. The contentDocument property refers to the document element inside the iframe (this is equivalent to contentWindow.document), but is not supported by Internet Explorer versions before IE8. From the inside of a frame, a script can get a reference to the parent window via window.parent. Scripts trying to access a frame's content are subject to the same-origin policy, and cannot access most of the properties in the other window object if it was loaded from a different domain. This also applies to a script inside a frame trying to access its parent window. Cross-domain communication can still be achieved with window.postMessage.

Users will see this displayed if the image URL is wrong, the image is not in one of the supported formats, or until the image is downloaded.  Usage note: Omitting this attribute indicates that the image is a key part of the content, but no textual equivalent is available. Setting this attribute to the empty string indicates that this image is not a key part of the content; non-visual browsers may omit it from the rendering.     border   Deprecated   in  HTML 4,   Obsolete in  HTML5 The width of a border around the image.   crossorigin  HTML5 This enumerated attribute indicates if the fetching of the related image must be done using CORS or not. CORS-enabled images can be reused in the <canvas>  element without being tainted. The allowed values are:  anonymous A cross-origin request (i.e. with Origin: HTTP header) is performed. But no credential is sent (i.e. no cookie, no X.509 certificate and no HTTP Basic authentication is sent). If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (by not setting the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: HTTP header), the image will be tainted and its usage restricted.. use-credentials A cross-origin request (i.e. with Origin: HTTP header) is performed with\u00a0 credential is sent (i.e. a cookie, a certificate and HTTP Basic authentication is performed). If the server does not give credentials to the origin site (through Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: HTTP header), the image will be tainted and its usage restricted.  When not present, the resource is fetched without a CORS request (i.e. without sending the Origin: HTTP header), preventing its non-tainted used in <canvas>  elements. If invalid, it is handled as if the enumerated keyword anonymous was used. See CORS settings attributes for additional information.   height The height of the image in  HTML5 CSS pixels, or  HTML 4 in pixels or as a percentage.   hspace   Deprecated   in  HTML 4,   Obsolete in  HTML5 The number of pixels of white space to insert to the left and right of the image.   ismap This Boolean attribute indicates that the image is part of a server-side map. If so, the precise coordinates of a click are sent to the server.  Usage note: This attribute is allowed only if the <img> element is a descendant of an <a>  element with a valid   href  attribute.     longdesc HTML 4 only The URL of a description of the image to be displayed, which supplements the alt text. In  HTML5, use a regular <a>  element to link to the description.   name   Deprecated   in  HTML 4,   Obsolete in  HTML5 A name for the element. It is supported in  HTML 4 only for backward compatibility. Use the id attribute instead.   src Image URL, this attribute is obligatory for the <img> element.   width The width of the image in pixels or percent.   usemap The partial URL (starting with '#') of an image map associated with the element.  Usage note: You cannot use this attribute if the <img> element is a descendant of an <a>  or <button> \u00a0element.     vspace   Deprecated   in  HTML 4,   Obsolete in  HTML5 The number of pixels of white space to insert to above and below the image. Supported image formats The HTML standard doesn't give a list of image format that must be supported, so each user agent supports a different set of formats. Gecko supports:  JPEG GIF, including animated GIFs PNG APNG  Requires Gecko 1.9.2  SVG  Requires Gecko 2.0  BMP BMP ICO PNG ICO  Requires Gecko 9.0    Note: Support for the XBM\u00a0format has been removed in Gecko 1.9.2.

Normative document HTML\u00a05, section 4.10.7; HTML 4.01, section 17.4    Attributes Like all other HTML\u00a0elements, this element supports the global attributes.    type The type of control to display. The default type is text, if this attribute is not specified. Possible values are:  button: A push button with no default behavior. checkbox:\u00a0A check box. You must use the value attribute to define the value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this item is selected. You can also use the indeterminate attribute to indicate that the checkbox is in an indeterminate state (on most platforms, this draws a horizontal line across the checkbox). color:  HTML5 A control for specifying a color. date:  HTML5 A control for entering a date (year, month, and day, with no time). datetime:  HTML5 A control for entering a date and time (hour, minute, second, and fraction of a second) based on UTC time zone. datetime-local:  HTML5 A control for entering a date and time, with no time zone. email:  HTML5 A field for editing an e-mail address. The :valid  and :invalid \u00a0CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate. file:\u00a0A control that lets the user select a file. Use the accept attribute to define the types of files that the control can select. hidden:\u00a0A control that is not displayed, but whose value is submitted to the server. image: A graphical submit button. You must use the src attribute to define the source of the image and the alt attribute to define alternative text. You can use the height and width attributes to define the size of the image in pixels. month:  HTML5 A control for entering a month and year, with no time zone. number:  HTML5 A control for entering a floating point number. password: A single-line text field whose value is obscured. Use the maxlength attribute to specify the maximum length of the value that can be entered. radio: A radio button. You must use the value attribute to define the value submitted by this item. Use the checked attribute to indicate whether this item is selected by default. Radio buttons that have the same value for the name attribute are in the same \"radio button group\"; only one radio button in a group can be selected at one time. range:  HTML5 A control for entering a number whose exact value is not important. This type control uses the following default values if the corresponding attributes are not specified:  min: 0 max: 100 value:\u00a0min + (max-min)\/2, or min if max is less than min step: 1   reset:\u00a0A button that resets the contents of the form to default values. search:  HTML5 A single-line text field for entering search strings; line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value. submit:\u00a0A button that submits the form. tel:  HTML5 A control for entering a telephone number; line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value, but no other syntax is enforced. You can use attributes such as pattern and maxlength to restrict values entered in the control. The :valid  and :invalid \u00a0CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate. text: A single-line text field; line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value. time:  HTML5 A control for entering a time value with no time zone. url:  HTML5 A field for editing a URL. The user may enter a blank or invalid address. Line-breaks are automatically removed from the input value. You can use attributes such as pattern and maxlength to restrict values entered in the control. The :valid  and :invalid \u00a0CSS pseudo-classes are applied as appropriate. week:  HTML5 A control for entering a date consisting of a week-year number and a week number with no time zone.     accept If the value of the type attribute is file, this attribute indicates the types of files that the server accepts; otherwise it is ignored. The value must be a comma-separated list of unique content type specifiers:  A valid MIME\u00a0type with no extensions audio\/* representing sound files  HTML5 video\/* representing video files  HTML5 image\/* representing image files  HTML5     accesskey  HTML 4 only,  Obsolete since HTML5 A single-character that the user can press to switch input focus to the control. This attribute is global in HTML5.   mozactionhint Non-standard      Specifies an \"action hint\" used to determine how to label the enter key on mobile devices with virtual keyboards. Supported values are go, done, next, search, and send; these automatically get mapped to the appropriate string (and are case-insensitive).   autocomplete  HTML5 This attribute indicates whether the value of the control can be automatically completed by the browser. This attribute is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type (button, submit, reset, image). Possible values are:  off: The user must explicitly enter a value into this field for every use, or the document provides its own auto-completion method; the browser does not automatically complete the entry. on: The browser can automatically complete the value based on values that the user has entered during previous uses.  If the autocomplete attribute is not specified on an input element, then the browser uses the autocomplete attribute value of the <input> element's form owner. The form owner is either the form element that this <input> element is a descendant of or the form element whose id is specified by the form attribute of the input element. For more information, see the autocomplete attribute in <form> .    autofocus  HTML5 This Boolean attribute lets you specify that a form control should have input focus when the page loads, unless the user overrides it, for example by typing in a different control. Only one form element in a document can have the autofocus attribute, which is a Boolean. It cannot be applied if the type attribute is set to hidden (that is, you cannot automatically set focus to a hidden control).   checked When the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox, the presence of this Boolean attribute indicates that the control is selected by default; otherwise it is ignored.   disabled This Boolean attribute indicates that the form control is not available for interaction. In particular, the click event will not be dispatched on disabled controls. This attribute is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden.    form  HTML5 The form element that the input element is associated with (its form owner). The value of the attribute must be an id of a <form>  element in the same document. If this attribute is not specified, this <input> element must be a descendant of a <form>  element. This attribute enables you to place <input> elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.   formaction HTML5 The URI\u00a0of a program that processes the information submitted by the input element, if it is a submit button or image. If specified, it overrides the   action  attribute of the element's form owner.   formenctype HTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the type of content that is used to submit the form to the server. Possible values are:  application\/x-www-form-urlencoded: The default value if the attribute is not specified. multipart\/form-data: Use this value if you are using an <input>  element with the   type  attribute set to file. text\/plain  If this attribute is specified, it overrides the   enctype  attribute of the element's form owner.    formmethod HTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute specifies the HTTP\u00a0method that the browser uses to submit the form. Possible values are:  post: The data from the form is included in the body of the form and is sent to the server. get: The data from the form are appended to the form attribute URI, with a '?' as a separator, and the resulting URI is sent to the server. Use this method when the form has no side-effects and contains only ASCII\u00a0characters.  If specified, this attribute overrides the   method  attribute of the element's form owner.    formnovalidate HTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this Boolean attribute specifies that the form is not to be validated when it is submitted. If this attribute is specified, it overrides the   novalidate  attribute of the element's form owner.   formtarget HTML5 If the input element is a submit button or image, this attribute is a name or keyword indicating where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. This is a name of, or keyword for, a browsing context (for example, tab, window, or inline frame). If this attribute is specified, it overrides the   target  attribute of the elements's form owner. The following keywords have special meanings:  _self:\u00a0Load the response into the same browsing context as the current one. This value is the default if the attribute is not specified. _blank: Load the response into a new unnamed browsing context. _parent:\u00a0Load the response into the parent browsing context of the current one. If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self. _top: Load the response into the top-level browsing context (that is, the browsing context that is an ancestor of the current one, and has no parent). If there is no parent, this option behaves the same way as _self.     height  HTML5 \u00a0If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the height of the image displayed for the button.   list  HTML5 Identifies a list of pre-defined options to suggest to the user. The value must be the id of a <datalist>  element in the same document. The browser displays only options that are valid values for this input element. This attribute is ignored when the type attribute's value is hidden, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type.   max  HTML5\u00a0 The maximum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be less than its minimum (min attribute) value.   maxlength  HTML5 If the value of the type attribute is text,\u00a0email,\u00a0search, password, tel, or url,\u00a0 this attribute specifies the maximum number of characters (in Unicode code points) that the user can enter; for other control types, it is ignored. It can exceed the value of the size attribute. If it is not specified, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. Specifying a negative number results in the default behavior; that is, the user can enter an unlimited number of characters. The constraint is evaluated only when the value of the attribute has been changed.   min  HTML5\u00a0 The minimum (numeric or date-time) value for this item, which must not be greater than its maximum (max attribute) value.   multiple HTML5 This Boolean attribute indicates whether the user can enter more than one value. This attribute applies when the type attribute is set to email or file; otherwise it is ignored.   name The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data.   pattern HTML5 A regular expression that the control's value is checked against. The pattern must match the entire value, not just some subset. Use the title attribute to describe the pattern to help the user. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored.   placeholder  HTML5 A hint to the user of what can be entered in the control . The placeholder text must not contain carriage returns or line-feeds. This attribute applies when the value of the type attribute is text, search, tel, url or email; otherwise it is ignored.   readonly This Boolean attribute indicates that the user cannot modify the value of the control.  HTML5 This attribute is ignored if the value of the type attribute is hidden, range, color, checkbox, radio, file, or a button type.    required  HTML5 This attribute specifies that the user must fill in a value before submitting a form. It cannot be used when the type attribute is hidden, image, or a button type (submit, reset, or button). The :optional  and :required  CSS pseudo-classes will be applied to the field as appropriate.   selectionDirection  HTML5 The direction in which selection occurred. This is \"forward\" if the selection was made from left-to-right in an LTR locale or right-to-left in an RTL\u00a0locale, or \"backward\" if the selection was made in the opposite direction. This can be \"none\"\u00a0if the selection direction is unknown.   size The initial size of the control. This value is in pixels unless the value of the type attribute is text or password, in which case, it is an integer number of characters. Starting in HTML5, this attribute applies only when the type attribute is set to text, search, tel, url, email, or password; otherwise it is ignored. In addition, the size must be greater than zero. If you don't specify a size, a default value of 20 is used.   src If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute specifies a URI for the location of an image to display on the graphical submit button; otherwise it is ignored.   step  HTML5 Works with the min and max attributes to limit the increments at which a numeric or date-time value can be set. It can be the string any or a positive floating point number. If this attribute is not set to any, the control accepts only values at multiples of the step value greater than the minimum.   tabindex element-specific in  HTML 4, global in  HTML5 The position of the element in the tabbing navigation order for the current document.   usemap\u00a0 HTML 4 only,  Obsolete since HTML5 The name of a <map> \u00a0element to as an image map.   value The initial value of the control. This attribute is optional except when the value of the type attribute is radio or checkbox. Note that when reloading the page, Gecko and IE will ignore the value specified in the HTML source, if the value was changed before the reload.   width  HTML5 \u00a0If the value of the type attribute is image, this attribute defines the width of the image displayed for the button.   x-moz-errormessage Non-standard      This Mozilla extension allows you to specify the error message to display when a field doesn't successfully validate.   Notes File inputs   Gecko 2.0 note(Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1)   Starting in\u00a0Gecko 2.0 (Firefox 4 \/ Thunderbird 3.3 \/ SeaMonkey 2.1) , calling the click() method on an <input>  element of type file opens the file picker and lets the user select files. See Using files from web applications for an example and more details.  You can't set the value of a file picker from a script; doing something like the following has no effect: \r           var e = getElementById(\"someFileInputElement\"); e.value = \"foo\";\r          Error messages If you want Firefox to present a custom error message when a field fails to validate, you can use the x-moz-errormessage attribute to do so: \r           <input type=\"email\" x-moz-errormessage=\"Please specify a valid email address.\">\r          Note, however, that this is not standard and will not have an effect on other browsers.

This attribute enables you to place <keygen> elements anywhere within a document, not just as descendants of their form elements.   keytype The type of key generated. The default value is RSA.   name The name of the control, which is submitted with the form data. Usage  The element is written as follows: \r           <keygen name=\"name\" challenge=\"challenge string\" keytype=\"type\" keyparams=\"pqg-params\">\r          The keytype parameter is used to specify what type of key is to be generated. Valid values are \"RSA\", which is the default, \"DSA\" and \"EC\". The name and challenge attributes are required in all cases. The keytype attribute is optional for RSA key generation and required for DSA and EC key generation. The keyparams attribute is required for DSA and EC key generation and ignored for RSA key generation. PQG is a synonym for keyparams. That is, you may specify keyparams=\"pqg-params\" or pqg=\"pqg-params\". For RSA keys, the keyparams parameter is not used (ignored if present). The user may be given a choice of RSA key strengths. Currently, the user is given a choice between \"high\" strength (2048 bits) and \"medium\" strength (1024 bits). For DSA keys, the keyparams parameter specifies the DSA PQG parameters which are to be used in the keygen process. The value of the pqg parameter is the the BASE64 encoded, DER encoded Dss-Parms as specified in IETF RFC 3279. The user may be given a choice of DSA key sizes, allowing the user to choose one of the sizes defined in the DSA standard. For EC keys, the keyparams parameter specifies the name of the elliptic curve on which the key will be generated. It is normally a string from the table in nsKeygenHandler.cpp. (Note that only a subset of the curves named there may actually be supported in any particular browser.) If the keyparams parameter string is not a recognized curve name string, then a curve is chosen according to the user's chosen key strength (low, medium, high), using the curve named \"secp384r1\" for high, and the curve named \"secp256r1\" for medium keys. (Note: choice of the number of key strengths, default values for each strength, and the UI by which the user is offered a choice, are outside of the scope of this specification.) The keygen element is only valid within an HTML form. It will cause some sort of selection to be presented to the user for selecting key size. The UI for the selection may be a menu, radio buttons, or possibly something else. The browser presents several possible key strengths. Currently, two strengths are offered, high and medium. If the user's browser is configured to support cryptographic hardware (e.g. \"smart cards\") the user may also be given a choice of where to generate the key, i.e., in a smart card or in software and stored on disk. When the submit button is pressed, a key pair of the selected size is generated. The private key is encrypted and stored in the local key database.

Possible uses for this element include defining a relational framework for navigation and linking the document to a style sheet.

Normative document HTML5, section 4.2.4 (HTML4.01, section 12.3)    Attributes Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.    charset  Obsolete This attribute defines the character encoding of the linked resource. The value is a space- and\/or comma-delimited list of character sets as defined in RFC 2045. The default value is ISO-8859-1. Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5 and must not be used by authors. To achieve its effect, use the Content-Type: HTTP header on the linked resource.      disabled Non-standard      This attribute is used to disable a link relationship. In conjunction with scripting, this attribute could be used to turn on and off various style sheet relationships. Usage note: This attribute is non-standard and only used by some Microsoft browsers. Do not use it. To achieve its effect, use one of the following techniques: \u00a0  If the disabled attribute has been added directly to the page, do not include the <link>  element instead; If the disabled attribute has been added via scripting, remove the element from the DOM\u00a0via scripting.        href This attribute specifies the URL of the linked resource. A URL might be absolute or relative.     hreflang This attribute indicates the language of the linked resource. It is purely advisory. Allowed values are determined by BCP47 for HTML5 and by RFC1766 for HTML 4. Use this attribute only if the   href  attribute is present.     media This attribute specifies the media which the linked resource applies to. Its value must be a media query. This attribute is mainly useful when linking to external stylesheets by allowing the user agent to pick the best adapted one for the device it runs on. Usage note:\u00a0 \u00a0  In HTML 4, this can only be a simple white-space-separated list of media description literals, i.e., media types and groups, where defined and allowed as values for this attribute, such as print, screen, aural, braille. HTML5 extended this to any kind of media queries, which are a superset of the allowed values of HTML 4. Browsers not supporting the CSS3 Media Queries won't necessary recognized the adequate link; do not forget to set fallback links,\u00a0 the restricted set of media queries defined in HTML 4.        methods Non-standard      The value of this attribute provides information about the functions that might be performed on an object. The values generally are given by the HTTP protocol when it is used, but it might (for similar reasons as for the title attribute) be useful to include advisory information in advance in the link. For example, the browser might choose a different rendering of a link as a function of the methods specified; something that is searchable might get a different icon, or an outside link might render with an indication of leaving the current site. This attribute is not well understood nor supported, even by the defining browser, Internet Explorer 4. See Methods Property (MSDN).   rel This attribute names a relationship of the linked document to the current document. The attribute must be a space-separated list of the link types values. The most common use of this attribute is to specify a link to an external style sheet:\u00a0the rel attribute is set to stylesheet, and the href attribute is set to the URL of an external style sheet to format the page. WebTV also supports the use of the value next for rel to preload the next page in a document series.     rev  Obsolete The value of this attribute shows the relationship of the current document to the linked document, as defined by the   href  attribute. The attribute thus defines the reverse relationship compared to the value of the rel attribute. Link types values for the attribute are similar to the possible values for   rel . Usage note: This attribute is obsolete in HTML5. Do not use it. To achieve its effect, use the   rel  attribute with the opposite link types values, e.g. made should be replaced by author. Also this attribute doesn't mean revision and must not be used with a version number, which is unfortunately the case on numerous sites.      sizes  HTML5 This attribute defines the sizes of the icons for visual media contained in the resource. It must be present only if the   rel  contains the icon link types value. It may have the following values:  any, meaning that the icon can be scaled to any size as it is in a vectorial format, like image\/svg. a white-space separated list of sizes, each in the format <width in pixels>x<height in pixels> or <width in pixels>X<height in pixels>. Each of these sizes must be contained in the resource.  Usage note:\u00a0 \u00a0  Most icon format are only able to store one single icon; therefore most of the time the   sizes  contains only one entry. Among the major browsers, only the Apple's ICNS format allows the storage of multiple icons, and this format is only supported in WebKit. Apple's iOS does not support this attribute, hence Apple's iPhone and iPad use special, non-standard link types values to define icon to be used as Web Clip or start-up placeholder: apple-touch-icon and apple-touch-startup-icon.        targetNon-standard      Defines the frame or window name that has the defined linking relationship or that will show the rendering of any linked resource.     type This attribute is used to define the type of the content linked to. The value of the attribute should be a MIME type such as text\/html, text\/css, and so on. The common use of this attribute is to define the type of style sheet linked and the most common current value is text\/css, which indicates a Cascading Style Sheet format.  DOM interface This element implements the HTMLLinkElement interface. Examples Including a stylesheet To include a stylesheet in a page, use the following syntax: \r           <link href=\"style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" media=\"all\">\r          Providing alternative stylesheets You can also specify alternative style sheets. The user can choose which style sheet to use by choosing it from the View>Page Style menu. This provides a way for users to see multiple versions of a page. \r           <link href=\"default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" title=\"Default Style\"> <link href=\"fancy.css\" rel=\"alternate stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" title=\"Fancy\"> <link href=\"basic.css\" rel=\"alternate stylesheet\" type=\"text\/css\" title=\"Basic\">\r          Stylesheet load events You can determine when a style sheet has been loaded by watching for a load event to fire on it; similarly, you can detect if an error has occurred while processing a style sheet by watching for an error event: \r           <script> function sheetLoaded() {   \/\/ Do something interesting; the sheet has been loaded }  function sheetError() {   alert(\"An error occurred loading the stylesheet!\"); } <\/script>  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"mystylesheet.css\" type=\"text\/css\" onload=\"sheetLoaded()\" onerror=\"sheetError()\">\r          Note: The load event fires once the stylesheet and all of its imported content has been loaded and parsed, and immediately before the styles start being applied to the content.

Notes  A <link> tag can occur only in the head element; however, there can be multiple occurrences of <link>. HTML 3.2 defines only the href, rel, rev, and title attributes for the link element. HTML 2 defines the href, methods, rel, rev, title, and urn attributes for the <link> element. The methods and urn attributes were later removed from the specifications. The HTML and XHTML specifications define event handlers for the <link> element, but it is unclear how they would be used. Under XHTML 1.0, empty elements such as <link> require a trailing slash: <link \/>.

According to the attributes set, the kind of metadata can be one of the following:  if the   name  is set, a document-level metadata, applying to the whole page; if the   http-equiv  is set, a pragma directive, i.e. information given to the webserver on how the webpage should be served; if the   charset  is set, a charset declaration, i.e. the charset used for the serialized-form of the webpage;  HTML5 if the   itemprop  is set, a user-defined metadata, transparent for the user-agent as the semantic of the metadata is user-specific. HTML5  Unimplemented   Usage context    Content categories Metadata content   Permitted content None, this is a void element.   Tag omission As it is a void element, the start tag must be present and the end tag must not be present   Permitted parent elements any element that accept metadata elements   Normative document HTML5, section 4.2.5 (HTML4.01, section 7.4.4.2)    Attributes Like all other HTML\u00a0elements, this element supports the global attributes. Note that the global   name  has a specific semantic in the <meta>  element and that the   itemprop  must not be set when one of the   name ,   http-equiv  or   charset  is already used.    charset  HTML5 This attribute declares the character encoding used of the page. It can be locally overridden using the lang attribute on any element. This attribute is a literal string and must be one of the preferred MIME name for a character encoding as defined by the IANA. Though the standard doesn't request a specific character encoding, it gives some recommendations about it:  Authors are encouraged to use UTF-8. Authors should not use ASCII-incompatible encodings (i.e. those that don't map the 8-bit code points 0x20 to 0x7E to the Unicode 0x0020 to 0x007E code points) as these represent a security risk: browsers non supporting them may interpret benign content as HTML\u00a0Elements. This is the case of at least the following charsets: JIS_C6226-1983, JIS_X0212-1990, HZ-GB-2312, JOHAB, the ISO-2022 family, and the EBCDIC family. Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and SCSU, also falling in that category and not intended to be used on the web. Cross-scripting attacks with some of these encodings have been documented. Authors should not use UTF-32 as not all HTML 5 encoding algorithm can distinguish it from UTF-16.  Notes:  The declared character set must match the one of the page. It is pointless, and will lead to a poor user experience, to declare an erroneous character set. This <meta>  element must be inside the <head>  element and within the 512 first bytes of the page, as some browsers only look at these first bytes before choosing a character set for the page. This <meta>  element is only a part of the algorithm to determine the character set of a page that browsers apply. Especially, the HTTP\u00a0Content-Type header and any BOM\u00a0elements have precedence over this element. It is good practice, and strongly recommended, to define the character set using this attribute. If no character set is defined for a page, several cross-scripting techniques may become practical to harm the page user, like the UTF-7\u00a0fallback cross-scripting technique. Always setting this meta will protect against these risks. This <meta>  element is a synonym for the pre-HTML5 <meta\u00a0http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text\/html;\u00a0charset=IANAcharset\"> where IANAcharset corresponds of the value of the equivalent   charset  attribute. This syntax is still allowed, although obsolete and no more recommended.      content This attribute gives the value associated with the   http-equiv  or   name  attribute, depending of the context.   http-equiv This enumerated attribute defines the pragma that can alter servers and user-agents behavior. The value of the pragma is defined using the   content  and can be one of the following:  content-language   Obsolete This pragma defines the default language of the page. Usage note: do not use this pragma, as it is no more recommended. Use the global lang attribute on the <body>  element instead.  content-type   Obsolete This attribute defines the MIME type of the document, eventually followed by its character set. It follows the same syntax as the HTTP content-type entity-header field, but as it is inside an HTML\u00a0Element, most value are not possible. Therefore the valid syntax for its content is the literal string 'text\/html' eventually followed by a character set with the following syntax:\u00a0'; charset=IANAcharset' where IANAcharset is the preferred MIME name for a character set as defined by the IANA Usage note:  Do not use this pragma, as it is no more recommended. Use the   charset  attribute on the <meta>  element instead. As the <meta>  may not be used to change the type of a document in an XHTML document, or in an HTML5 document following the XHTML syntax, never set set MIME\u00a0type to an XHTML MIME type that way. It would be incorrect. Only HTML document can use the content-type, so most of it is redundant: that's why it has been obsoleted and replaset by the   charset  attribute.    default-style This pragma specifies the preferred stylesheet to be used on the page. The   content  attribute must contains the id of a <link>  element whose   href  attribute links to a CSS stylesheet, or the id of a <style>  element which contains a CSS stylesheet. refresh This pragma specifies:  the number of seconds until the page should be reloaded, if the   content  attribute contains only a positive integer number; the number of seconds until the page should be redirected to another, if the   content  attribute contains a positive integer number followed by the string ';url=' and a valid URL.   set-cookie   Obsolete This pragma defines a cookie for the page. Its content must follows the syntax defines in the IETF HTTP\u00a0Cookie Specification. Note: Do not use this pragma as it is obsolete. Use the HTTP header set-cookie instead.      name This attribute defines the name of a document-level metadata. It should not be set if one of the attribute   itemprop ,   http-equiv  or   charset  is also set. This document-level metadata name is associated with a value, contained by the   content  attribute. The possible values for the name element are, with their associated value stored via the   content  attribute:  application-name, defining the name of the web application running in the webpage; Note:  browsers may use this to identify the application. It is different from the <title>  element, which usually consist of\u00a0 the application name but may also contain specific information like the document name or a status; simple webpages shouldn't defines the application-name meta.    author, defining, in a free format, the name of the author of the document; description, containing a short and accurate summary of the content of the page. Several browsers, among them Firefox and Opera, use this meta as the default description of the page when bookmarked; generator, containing, in a free format, the identifier to the software that generated the page; keywords, containing, as strings separated by commas, relevant words associated with the content of the page.  The attribute may also have a value taken from the extended list defined on WHATWG Wiki MetaExtensions page. Also none has been formally accepted yet, a few commonly used names are among the proposals:  creator, defining, in a free format, the name of the creator of the document. Note that it can be the name of the institution. If there are more than one, several <meta>  element should be used; googlebot, which is a synonym of robots, but is only followed by Googlebot, the indexing crawler for Google; publisher, defining, in a free format, the name of the publisher of the document. Note that it can be the name of the institution; robots, defining the behavior that cooperative crawlers should have with the page. It is a comma-separated list of values taken in the following list:  Values for the content of <meta name=\"robots\">   Value Description Used by     index Allows the robot to index the page All   noindex Prevents the robot to index the page All   follow Allows the robot to follow the links on the page All   nofollow Prevents the robot to follow the links on the page All   noodp Prevents the usage of the Open Directory Project description, if any, as the description of the page in the search engine results page  Google, Yahoo, Bing    noarchive Prevents the search engine to cache the content of the page Google, Yahoo   nosnippet Prevents the display of any description of the page in the search engine results page Google   noimageindex Prevents this page to appear as the referring page of an indexed image Google   noydir Prevents the usage of the Yahoo Directory description, if any, as the description of the page in the search engine results page Yahoo   nocache Synonym of noarchive Bing    Notes:  Only cooperative robots will follow the rules defined by the robots name. Do not expect to keep e-mail harvesters at bay with this The robot still needs to access the page in order to read the meta value. If you want to keep them at bay, for example to prevent bandwidth consumption, use a robots.txt file instead (or in complement). If you want to remove the page of an index, changing the meta to noindex will work, but only when the robot visit the page again. Be sure not to prevent such visit, via the robots.txt file for example. Some search engines have developers tools allowing a quick removal of some page. Some possible values are mutually exclusive, like using index and noindex, or follow and nofollow, at the same time. In these case the behavior of the robot is undefined, and may vary from one to the other. So avoid these cases. Some search engine crawler robots, like those of Google, Yahoo\u00a0Search or Bing, supports the same values on an HTTP directive, X-Robot-Tags: this allows to use these pragma on non-HTML documents, like images.    slurp, which is a synonym of robots, but is only followed by Slurp, the indexing crawler for Yahoo Search;  Finally a few names are in common use, though not in progress of being standardized:  viewport, which gives hints about the size of the initial size of the viewport. This pragma is used by several mobile devices only.  Values for the content of <meta name=\"viewport\">   Value Possible values Description     width a positive integer number or the literal device-width defines the width, in pixels, of the viewport   heigth a positive integer number of the literal device-height defines the height, in pixels, of the viewport   initial-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the ratio between the device width (device-width in portrait mode or device-height in landscape mode) and the viewport size.e   maximum-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the maximum value of the zoom; it must be greater or equal to the minimum-scale or the behavior is underterminate.   minimum-scale a positive number between 0.0 and 10.0 defines the minimum value of the zoom; it must be smaller or equal to the maximum-scale or the behavior is undeterminate.   user-scalable a boolean value (yes or no) If set to no, the user is not able to zoom or in the webpage. Default value is yes.    Notes:  Though not standardized, this attribute is used by different mobile browsers like Safari Mobile, Firefox for Mobile or Opera Mobile. The default values may change from one device, and browser, to another To learn about this pragma in Firefox for Mobile, see\u00a0this article.        scheme   Obsolete This attribute defines the scheme in which the metadata is described. A scheme is a context leading to the correct interpretations of the   content  value, like a format.  Notes: Do not use this attribute as it has been deprecated. There is no replacement for it as there was no real usage for it. Omit it altogether.   DOM\u00a0interface This element implements the HTMLMetaElement interface.

Normative document HTML5, section 4.3.1 (HTML4.01, section 18.2.1)    Attributes Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.    async  HTML5 Set this Boolean attribute to indicate that the browser should, if possible, execute the script asynchronously. It has no effect on inline scripts (i.e., scripts that don't have the src attribute). In older browsers that don't support the async attribute, parser-inserted scripts block the parser; script-inserted scripts execute asynchronously in IE and WebKit, but synchronously in Opera and pre-4.0 Firefox. In Firefox 4.0, the async DOM\u00a0property defaults to true for script-created scripts, so the default behavior matches the behavior of IE\u00a0and WebKit. To request script-inserted external scripts be executed in the insertion order in browsers where the document.createElement(\"script\").async evaluates to true (such as Firefox 4.0), set .async=false on the scripts you want to maintain order. Never call document.write() from an async script. In Gecko 1.9.2, calling document.write() has an unpredictable effect. In Gecko 2.0, calling document.write() from an async script has no effect (other than printing a warning to the error console).   src This attribute specifies the URI of an external script; this can be used as an alternative to embedding a script directly within a document. script elements with an src attribute specified should not have a script embedded within its tags.   type This attribute identifies the scripting language of code embedded within a script element or referenced via the element\u2019s src attribute. This is specified as a MIME type; examples of supported MIME types include text\/javascript, text\/ecmascript, application\/javascript, and application\/ecmascript. If this attribute is absent, the script is treated as JavaScript.   language   Deprecated   Like the type attribute, this attribute identifies the scripting language in use. Unlike the type attribute, however, this attribute\u2019s possible values were never standardized. The type attribute should be used instead.   defer This Boolean attribute is set to indicate to a browser that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed. Since this feature hasn't yet been implemented by all other major browsers, authors should not assume that the script\u2019s execution will actually be deferred. Never call document.write() from a defer script (since Gecko 1.9.2, this will blow away the document). The defer attribute shouldn't be used on scripts that don't have the src attribute. Since Gecko 1.9.2, the defer attribute is ignored on scripts that don't have the src attribute. However, in Gecko 1.9.1 even inline scripts are deferred if the defer attribute is set.

Typically, it contents a description of it to allow visually impaired people, like blind people browsing the web using Braille screen, to get the information in it. If the information added in this attribute may also be useful for non-visually impaired people, consider using the <caption>  instead. The summary attribute is not mandatory and may be omitted when a <caption>  element fulfills its role. Usage Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated.

It may have the following values:    \u00a0 above \u00a0 below   \u00a0 hsides \u00a0 vsides   \u00a0 lhs \u00a0 rhs   \u00a0 border \u00a0 box   \u00a0 void    Usage note:\u00a0Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the <table>  element should be styled using CSS. To give a similar effect than the frame attribute, use the CSS properties border-style  and border-width .      rules  Deprecated   This enumerated attribute defines where rules, i.e. lines, should appear in a table. It can have the following values:  none, which indicates the no rules will be displayed; it is the default value; groups, which will make the rules to be displayed between row groups (defined by the <thead> , <tbody>  and <tfoot>  elements) and between column groups (defined by the <col>  and <colgroup>  elements) only; rows, which will make the rules to be displayed between rows; columns, which will make the rules to be displayed between columns; all, which wil make the rules to be displayed between rows and columns.  Note:  The styling of the rules is browser-dependant and cannot be modified. Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the rules should be defined and styled using CSS. use the CSS property border  on the adequate <thead> , <tbody> , <tfoot> , <col>  or <colgroup>  elements.        summary  Deprecated   This attribute defines an alternative text use to describe the table in user-agent unable to display it. Typically, it contents a description of it to allow visually impaired people, like blind people browsing the web using Braille screen, to get the information in it. If the information added in this attribute may also be useful for non-visually impaired people, consider using the <caption>  instead. The summary attribute is not mandatory and may be omitted when a <caption>  element fulfills its role. Usage Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated. Instead, use one of these way of describing a table:  In prose, surrounding the table (this is the less semantic-conveying way of doing it). In the table's <caption>  element. In a <details>  element, inside the table's <caption>  element. Include the <table>  element in a <figure>  element and add the description in prose next to it. Include the <table>  element in a <figure>  element and add the description in prose inside a <figcaption>  element. Adjust the table so that such description is no more needed, by using <th>  and <thead>  elements for example.        width   Deprecated   This attribute defines the width of the table. It may either be a pixel length or a percentage value, representing the percentage of the width of its container that the table should use. Usage Note: Do not use this attribute, as it has been deprecated: the rules should be defined and styled using CSS. use the CSS property width  instead.

Normative document HTML 5, section 4.8.6    Attributes Like all other HTML elements, this element supports the global attributes.    autoplay A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video will automatically begin to play back as soon as it can do so without stopping to finish loading the data.   autobuffer Non-standard        Obsolete A Boolean attribute; if specified, the video will automatically begin buffering even if it's not set to automatically play. This should be used for cases in which it is considered likely that the video will be played (for example, if the user navigated to the page specifically to play the video, not if there happens to be a video embedded along with other content). The video is buffered until the media cache is full. Implementation note: though part of the early drafts of the HTML5 specification, the autobuffer attribute has been removed in later releases. It has been removed from Gecko 2.0 and other browsers, and never implemented in some. The spec defines a new enumerated attribute, preload, to replace the autobuffer attribute, with a different syntax.   bug 548523     buffered An attribute you can read to determine which time ranges of the media have been buffered. This attribute contains a TimeRanges  object.   controls If this attribute is present, Gecko will offer controls to allow the user to control video playback, including volume, seeking, and pause\/resume playback.   height The height of the video's display area, in CSS pixels.   loop A Boolean attribute; if specified, we will, upon reaching the end of the video, automatically seek back to the start.   muted A Boolean attribute which indicates the default setting of the audio contained in the video. If set, the audio will be initially silenced. Its default value is false, meaning that the audio will be played when the video is played.   preload This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:  none: hints that either the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video or that the server wants to minimize its traffic; in others terms this hint indicates that the video should not be cached. metadata: hints that though the author thinks that the user won't need to consult that video, fetching the metadata (e.g. length) is reasonable. auto: hints that the user needs have priority; in others terms this hint indicated that, if needed, the whole video could be downloaded, even if the user is not expected to use it. the empty string: which is a synonym of the auto value.  If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser can choose its own default value), though the spec advises it to be set to metadata. Usage notes:  The autoplay attribute has precedence over this one as if one wants to automatically play a video, the browser will obviously need to download it. Setting both the autoplay and the preload attributes is allowed by the specification. The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute; it is a mere hint.      poster A URL indicating a poster frame to show until the user plays or seeks. If this attribute isn't specified, nothing is displayed until the first frame is available; then the first frame is displayed as the poster frame.   src The URL of the video to embed. This is optional; you may instead use the <source>  element within the video block to specify the video to embed.   width The width of the video's display area, in CSS pixels.  Time offsets are currently specified as a float value representing the number of seconds to offset. Note: The time offset value definition has not yet been completed in the HTML\u00a05 specification and is subject to change.Examples \r           <!-- Simple video example --> <video src=\"videofile.ogg\" autoplay poster=\"posterimage.jpg\">   Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos,    but don't worry, you can <a href=\"videofile.ogg\">download it<\/a>   and watch it with your favorite video player! <\/video>  <!-- Video with subtitles --> <video src=\"foo.ogg\">   <track kind=\"subtitles\" src=\"foo.en.vtt\" srclang=\"en\" label=\"English\">   <track kind=\"subtitles\" src=\"foo.sv.vtt\" srclang=\"sv\" label=\"Svenska\"> <\/video>\r          The first example plays a video, starting playback as soon as enough of the video has been received to allow playback without pausing to download more. Until the video starts playing, the image \"posterimage.jpg\" is displayed in its place. The second example allows the user to choose between different subtitles. Server support It's worth re-emphasizing for the time being, that if the MIME types for Theora video are not set on the server, the video may not show or show a gray box containing an X (if JavaScript is enabled). You can fix this problem for the Apache Web Server by adding the extension used by your Theora video files (\".ogm\", \".ogv\", or \".ogg\" are the most common ones) to the MIME type \"video\/ogg\" via the \"mime.types\" file in \"\/etc\/apache\" or\u00a0 via the \"AddType\" configuration directive in httpd.conf.  AddType video\/ogg .ogm AddType video\/ogg .ogv AddType video\/ogg .ogg  Your web host may provide an easy interface to MIME type configuration changes for new technologies until a global update naturally occurs.
